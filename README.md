## Group members

This project was made by Khelifi Mouez (188409) - Chini Emanuale (202488) - MalagÃ² Francesco (172080)

## Introduction

The project's scope is to create a virtual network to compare the performance of HTTP/3 with respect to HTTP/2 and TCP.
To do this we used Vagrant and Virtualbox for managing the virtual machines, and Docker to run the web-server.

Suggested reference: https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-http-3-using-nginx-and-quiche/

## Why Http/3 + Quic?

Quic is beneficial in many cases:

* **Faster handshake**: In a TLS handshake the are 4 round-trip requests involved, plus those needed by TCP. Quic replaces all of this with a single handshake.
* **No head-of-line blocking**: In Http/2 a single lost packet can block an entire line of data. Quic solves this problem by allowing streams of data to reach their destination independently.
* **Network switching will not affect connection**: In the classic case where a mobile device switches from a WiFi connection to a mobile network, all TCP connections are lost. Quic prevents this by giving each connection to a web server a unique identifier.

## Design

The network setup is the following:

* One host used as a client
* One host used as a web-server
* One host used as a router

The client will be connected to the router, and the router to the web-server which belongs to a different subnet, creating a realistic yet simple situation.

The web-server will run 3 Docker containers, one for each protocol to be tested.
The client will run Google Chrome.
The entire environment will be managed by Vagrant. 

| Host         | Interface     | IP address  | Subnet  |
| -------------| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Client       | enp0s8        | 192.168.0.2 |    1    |
| Router       | enp0s8        | 192.168.0.1 |    1    |
| Router       | enp0s9        | 192.168.2.1 |    2    |
| Web-server   | enp0s8        | 192.168.2.2 |    2    |

The 3 Docker containers are reachable through the following ports:

| Protocol      | Ports         | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| TCP           |   100 , 743   |
| HTTP/2        |   90  , 643   |
| HTTP/3 + QUIC |   80  , 443   |

More on this will be discussed in the [deployment part](#deployment)

## Implementation

In order to create such environment, we modified the vagrant file and created one start-up script for each host.
Then we configured Docker, the details of this will be discussed below.

### Vagrant

The important things to highlight in the vagrant file are the following:

- The OS chosen for the hosts is ubuntu/bionic64
- The client and the server have 1024 MB of RAM to be able to run the docker images
- To use the browser and the related dev tools it's necessary to add the following lines: 
```Ruby
  config.ssh.forward_agent = true
  config.ssh.forward_x11 = true
```
It's also necesary, for the host machine, to run an X-server, like Xming.

### Docker

The Docker image used is based on NGINX 1.16.1 over Ubuntu 18.04 in order to use the [Quiche patch](https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-http-3-using-nginx-and-quiche/).

#### TLS certificates

In order to function, Quic needs TLS certificates that can be issued with this command:

```bash
certbot certonly --standalone --non-interactive --agree-tos -d your.domain.com -m your@email.com
```

#### Web-server image

In the `docker` directory we can find a file named `Dockerfile`, this file contains all the commands needed to build the Docker image.

At this point the image is configured to use Http/3, but can be forced to use Http/2 and TCP as well editing the respective configuration file found in the confs directory.

We also have registered a [DuckDns domain](https://www.duckdns.org/) to which we have associated the `192.168.2.2` address and the TLS certificates issued earlier.
Client wise, this domain is echoed through the command `echo '192.168.2.2 dncs-http3.duckdns.org' >> /etc/hosts`

#### Websites

There are 3 Docker containers running on the web-server, in each container runs a Docker image where the following 3 websites can be found:

  - Game of Thrones

#### Characteristics 
|                    | Game of Thrones  | Global master  | Eforlad travel  |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Weight             | 3 MB             | 1 MB           | 2 MB            |
| Number of requests | 39               | 19             | 56              |

## Deployment

After cloning the repository, the system can be run by using `vagrant up`
This will create the virtual machines and will run each start-up script.

In `web-server.sh` there are 3 similar lines that are:

```
sudo docker run --name nginx3 -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443/tcp -p 443:443/udp -v /vagrant/docker/confs/http3.nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v /vagrant/docker/certs/:/etc/nginx/certs/ -v /vagrant/docker/web/:/etc/nginx/html/ mouezkhelifi/nginx-quic

sudo docker run --name nginx2 -d -p 90:80 -p 643:443/tcp -p 643:443/udp -v /vagrant/docker/confs/http2.nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v /vagrant/docker/certs/:/etc/nginx/certs/ -v /vagrant/docker/web/:/etc/nginx/html/ mouezkhelifi/nginx-quic

sudo docker run --name nginx1 -d -p 100:80 -p 743:443/tcp -p 743:443/udp -v /vagrant/docker/confs/tcp.nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v /vagrant/docker/certs/:/etc/nginx/certs/ -v /vagrant/docker/web/:/etc/nginx/html/ mouezkhelifi/nginx-quic
```

These 3 lines will run the Docker image mouezkhelifi/nginx-quic hosted on [the official Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mouezkhelifi/nginx-quic) using the 3 `.conf` files discussed earlier in order to use all protocols.
As mentioned in the [design part](#design) each protocol has its own ports defined by these 3 lines.

In order to run Google Chrome and evaluate the performance we have already enabled the X11 forwarding and run Xming.

We now need an SSH client, for example Putty.

Putty needs the Vagrant SSH key, using PuttyGen navigate to `.vagrant\machines\default\virtualbox` and generate a private key.
After loading the private key in Putty, make sure to enable X11 forwarding, this will be needed in the next part.
A more in depth guide can be found in the [References](#other-references).

## Performance evaluation

As mentioned earlier, to compare the various protocols performance we used Google Chrome, its Dev Tools and Lighthouse.

After the system is running, Chrome must be run using this command:

```bash
google-chrome --enable-quic --quic-version=h3-29
```
This will launch Chrome and enable quic.


### Evaluation criteria

- Page weight: the total weight of the entire page
- Number of requests: how many requests were made by the browser in the process
- Load time: the total time needed to load the page

### Lightouse report
In addition to the Dev Tools we decided to use Lightouse to create reports which measure the performance of the protocols. 
The Lighthouse Performance score is a  weighted average of 6 metric scores.
These are:
|Audit|	Weight|
| -------- | -------- |
|First Contentful Paint|	15%|
|  Speed Index	|  15%|
|Largest Contentful Paint|  	25|
|Time to Interactive|  	15%|
|Total Blocking Time|  	25%|  
|Cumulative Layout Shift|  	5%|  

Report settings:
- Network: 40 ms TCP RTT, 10,240 kbps throughput
- CPU throttling: 1x slowdown

## Conclusions
Although we thought the HTTP3+QUIC was the fastest protocol, during the experiments and as can be seen in the results, the TCP protocol was the swiftest.
Another important statement is that the loading time is more influenced by the number of requst instead of the page weight. In fact, the page Game of Thrones has more requests, 39 vs 56 of Erforlad travel, and its time, using TCP as reference, is 537 ms vs 916 ms.

Http/3 is still in the development phase, in the future, we could expect increased performance in a real-world scenario where UDP connections, parallel loading of resources and better congestion control will play a significant role.
